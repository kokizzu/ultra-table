# ultra_table is an implementation of memory table for Go


Ultra_table is an implementation of a memory table, which supports the automatic generation of multi-dimensional memory indexes based on the structure structure, so that index-based query, delete, and update achieve a relatively good performance.

We try to apply sdk to internal applications.
At the same time, I hope to receive more suggestions.
