# ultra_table is an implementation of memory table for Go
=======

## Overview
Ultra_table is an zero copy of a memory table, which supports the automatic generation of multi-dimensional memory indexes based on the struct, so that index-based query, delete, and update achieve a relatively good performance.

We try to apply sdk to internal applications.
At the same time, I hope to receive more suggestions.


### Getting started
To install Ultra_table, use `go get`:

```sh
$ go get github.com/longbridgeapp/ultra-table
```
